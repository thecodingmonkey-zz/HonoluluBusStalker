# Honolulu Bus Stalker

This project is intended to be a proof of concept to show that it is possible to have a real time Google Map with bus locations.  

Notes before running this:

1) Update trips.js to be up to date with the current timetables (quarterly feed data can be found at https://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeeds )

2) In map.html, put your TheBus API key as the variable apikey.  (Sign up for a key http://hea.thebus.org/api_info.asp)
